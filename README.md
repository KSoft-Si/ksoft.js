# ksoft.js

The KSoft.Si API sadly doesn't exist anymore, so this library is deprecated.

Depending on what you used it for, you might find the following alternatives interesting:

- User Trust: [the ravy.org API](https://ravy.org/api) (free, application required for non-KSoft users, ksoft users can use their KSoft token but are encouraged to also apply)
- Weather: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (limited free tier)
- Weather: [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en) (unlimited free tier without API key)
- Currency: [MasterCard](https://developer.mastercard.com/enhanced-currency-conversion-calculator/documentation/api-reference/) (???)
